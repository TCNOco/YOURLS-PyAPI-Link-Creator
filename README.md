# YOURLS-PyAPI-Link-Creator
Creates and copies short links to your clipboard, based off of user input.

This is a super simple cross-platform interface for using the YOURLS API to add short links. Running a simple .bat file with a loop is a lot simpler than waiting for the webpage to reload, adding one at a time.
Script also handles ampersand in the URLs, that sometime break the API.
